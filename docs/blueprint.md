# **App Name**: Shangri-La Sounds

## Core Features:

- Audio Gallery: Display a list of audio tracks with their respective names fetched from the provided list. Each name will be a clickable link.
- Audio Player: Implement a custom audio player UI similar to Spotify, that can play, pause, skip, and control volume.
- Dynamic Track Pages: Generate a dedicated page for each track in the list, which includes a customized audio player, track name and potentially other content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark Blue (#00008B) to create a sophisticated and immersive atmosphere.
- Text color: White (#FFFFFF) for high contrast and readability against the dark blue background.
- Hover color: Yellow (#FFFF00) to provide clear feedback on interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clean readability. This will be used for both the gallery list and the player information on each track page.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for player controls (play, pause, skip, volume) to maintain a modern and intuitive user experience.
